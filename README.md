Personal machine learning project for an model and application that could output the number of fingers that a person is holding up. Collaborated by me and a friend. A toy project to demonstrate what we've learned in our summer self-study of machine learning.

The model architecture is the original LeNet and was created using the Pytorch framework. The model is trained on ~2000 images of fingers obtained from online databases and obtained >95% accuracy on the test dataset. The interface was created using OpenCV libraries.

A web-to-commandline program to scrape text data from wikipedia. The specific scope of program is specifically WWII articles using the WWII portal as the origin. Made using the Wikipedia API. Parameters are interactable using text prompts to choose a specific page, browse general topics, or get a random page.

Documentation and architecture is included in the "Project Documentation.pdf" file.

Made for use in CS50.

## B Field Trajectory Plotter, E Field Trajectory Plotter
A small python program using the numpy and the matplotlib.pyplot libraries to create a graph for the trace of electric and magnetic fields. Parameters are the fixed variable scalar arguments of the electric and magnetic field. Made for use in PHY250: Electricity and Magnetism at the University of Toronto.


# Lab Reports
## PRES_REPORT
Statistical analysis of whether economic indicators such as R. GDP Growth, Inflation Rate, Unemployment Rate, etc. were robust estimators for presidential approval. Included within are a data preprocessing program using python and the pandas package, a data analysis program using R, and the report itself. The predominant model used is linear regression. The report discusses the transforms to better fit the data as well as diagnostics, strengths, and shortcomings.

Made for STA302.

## CHEM_IA and PHY_IA
Lab reports made for the International Baccaleurate program. For the physics course I investigated the effects of a solenoidal magnetic field and its magnitude as a dependent variable on number of coils. For the chemistry course I investigated the effects of temperature and concentration of a solute on the conductivity of a solution. In all of these experiments I utilized and programmed imaging and database software to perform my analysis.
